# Commitment

## About the Project

This project is the second assignment in David Schaal's Creative Web Development class for Spring of 2022. For this project, we had to make 100 commits to github and style an html page with CSS.

## Project Design

There was no required way to design the project on the assignment page, and we were encouraged to do whatever popped in our heads in order to style our pages. As such, my project doesn't have a super clear overarching theme. I just coded whatever popped into my head and included the files I already had on my computer (all while trying to make sure the website was at least aesthetically pleasing).

## Final Thoughts

The openess of this assignment left me kind of unsure of what to do at first, but I think I eventually got a hang of things. If there are any noticable typos or errors, please let me know and I'll do my best to correct them.

At the very least though, it felt refreshing to code in css again. It has been nearly 2 years since I've touched the coding language, so it was nice finally being able to pick it up again (even if that meant I had to re-teach myself everything).
